# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


To run project locally run the following commands

npm install

npm run dev

This will locally run the project on port 5173

http://localhost:5173/signup On signing up we will redirect to Login Page

http://localhost:5173/login After signup, then Logging in with the credentials

http://localhost:5173/dashboard After Login we will redirect to dashboard page, then On clicking Book Flight button redirect to /book-flight endpoint

http://localhost:5173/book-flight On reaching here you will complete the dummy transaction
